'''Assignment No. 2
Title of the Assignment: Data Wrangling, II
Create an “Academic performance” dataset of students and perform the following
operations using Python.
1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies. If there are missing values
and/or inconsistencies, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them.
2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers. If there are outliers, use any of the suitable
techniques to deal with them.
3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables. The purpose of this
transformation should be one of the following reasons: to change the scale for
better understanding of the variable, to convert a non-linear relation into a linear
one, or to decrease the skewness and convert the distribution into a normal
distribution. Reason and document your approach properly.'''
