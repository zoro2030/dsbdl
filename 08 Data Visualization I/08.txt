'''ASSIGNMENT NO. 8
Title of the Assignment: Data Visualization I
1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic'. The dataset contains 891 rows and contains information
about the passengers who boarded the unfortunate Titanic ship. Use the Seaborn library to
see if we can find any patterns in the data.
2. Write a code to check how the price of the ticket (column name: 'fare') for each passenger 
is distributed by plotting a histogram'''

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
dataset = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
dataset.head()

#Ploting Histogram Matplotlib
'''The Dist Plot
The distplot() shows the histogram distribution of data for a single column. The column name 
is passed as a parameter to the distplot() function.
'''
#You can clearly see that for more than 700 passengers, the ticket price is between 0 and 50.
sns.displot(dataset['fare'], kde=False, bins=10)

#. The Joint Plot
'''The Joint Plot :
The jointplot()is used to display the mutual distribution of each column. You need to pass 
three parameters to jointplot.'''
sns.jointplot(x='age', y='fare', data=dataset, kind='hex')
#you can see that most of the passengers are between age 20 and 30 and 
most of them paid between 10-50 for the tickets

#The Pair Plot
'''The paitplot() is a type of distribution plot that basically plots a joint plot for all the possible 
combination of numeric and Boolean columns in your dataset. '''
sns.pairplot(dataset)

#The Rug Plot
'''The rugplot() is used to draw small bars along x-axis for each point in the dataset. To plot a 
rug plot, you need to pass the name of the column. Let's plot a rug plot for fare.'''
sns.rugplot(dataset['fare'])
